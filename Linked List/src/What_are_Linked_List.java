	 * What are Linked List?
	 * A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not
	 * stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are
	 * linked using pointers as shown below:
	 * 
	 *  Head
	 * ___|________    ________    ________    ________
	 * |__A__|____| -> |_B_|__| -> |_C_|__| -> |_D_|__| -> Null
	 *  Data  Next
	 *  
	 *  In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains
	 *  a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
