	 * What is space complexity?
	 * Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working 
	 * storage an algorithm needs. That means how much memory,
	 * in the worst case, is needed at any point in the algorithm.
	 * As with the time complexity, we are mostly concerned with
	 * how the space needs grow, in big-Oh terms, as the size N 
	 * of the input problem grows.
