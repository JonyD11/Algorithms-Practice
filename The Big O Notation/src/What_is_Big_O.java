	/*
	 * Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting
	 * behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular
	 * value or infinity.
	 * 
	 * We use Big O to describe the performance of an algorithm.
	 * 
	 * For example: -
	 * Accessing an array elements in index is super fast but arrays has a fixed
	 * length and if you want to constantly add or remove items from them we have
	 * to get re-sized and it would get costly as the size of our input grows 
	 * very large.
	 * Using a Linked List it would grows and shrink very quickly but accessing a
	 * linked list element by index is slow 
	 * That's the reason we need to learn more about Big O
	 *
